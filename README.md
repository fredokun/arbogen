Arbogen is a fast uniform random generator of tree structures.
The tool reads a grammar file describing a tree structure
(e.g. binary trees, 2-3-4 trees, etc.) and a size interval
(eg. trees of size 1000+-100). From the grammar one or
many trees satisfying the structure and the size interval
are produced (following simple file formats).
The generated tree are generated with a guarantee of uniformity,
which means that it is the "average" tree for the given size.

Note: this example is a plane rooted tree of more than 100.000 nodes obtained in a few seconds on a standard PC.

----

Internally, the tool is based on recent advances in analytic
combinatorics and Boltzmann generators. The generation is
roughly linear in the size of the trees, which means huge
trees (e.g. of more than 1 millions nodes) can be generated
in a few seconds, memory management being the main
performance bottleneck.

Arbogen can be used in the very many situations when tree-shaped
data structures must be manipulated, e.g. in random testing.

## Build & install arbogen

Arbogen is packaged as a library and command line tool. The library exposes the
internal grammar representation, our oracle implementation and the random
generator for use as part of other projects. Note that the library should be
considered rather unstable and *will* change in the future.

Arbogen is packaged for the `opam` package manager. This means that it can be
installed in your current switch by running `opam install .`. Opam will resolve
all the dependencies.

If you just want opam to install the dependencies but don't want to install
arbogen, run `opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc`. The explicit
list of all dependencies can be found in `dune-project`.

To build arbogen manually, run `dune build @install` or `make build`.

### Documentation

A documentation can be build using `dune build @doc` or `make doc`. Please feel
free to open an issue if you need some parts of the documentation to be
clarified.
